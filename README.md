# list_zpool_multipath_devices

         Conception and birth. Needed a quick tool to tie zpool
         mulitpath devices to physical disk drives inside the
         Dell MD3060e.

         This script was written on and for:
              CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)
              ZFS 0.6.5.3-1.el7.centos
              Dell Storage Enclosure Management Software 1.3.0

         Next time, try doing something with XML output from
         "secli global topology".
